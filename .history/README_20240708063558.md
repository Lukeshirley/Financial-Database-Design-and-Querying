# Financial Database Design and Querying

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a comprehensive financial database and performing complex queries to analyze financial data. The database includes tables for customers, accounts, loans, and transactions.

## Database Schema

- **Customers Table**: Stores customer information.
- **Accounts Table**: Stores account information linked to customers.
- **Loans Table**: Stores loan information linked to customers.
- **Transactions Table**: Stores transaction information linked to accounts.

## SQL Scripts

### create.sql

Contains SQL commands to create the database and tables.

### customer_data.sql

Contains SQL commands to insert sample data into the Customers, Accounts, Loans, and Transactions tables.

### total_interest_paid.sql

Contains SQL commands to calculate the total interest paid by each customer.

### profit.sql

Contains SQL commands to calculate the net amount of transactions for each account.

### summary.sql

Contains SQL commands to generate a monthly summary of transactions.

## Query Results

### Total Interest Paid

Include a screenshot or text output of the `total_interest_paid.sql` query results here.

### Profit Calculation

Include a screenshot or text output of the `profit.sql` query results here.

### Monthly Summary

Include a screenshot or text output of the `summary.sql` query results here.

## Conclusion

Summarize what you learned and how the project demonstrates your SQL skills. Discuss any challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Highlight the significance of each query and its practical applications in financial analysis.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `create.sql` to set up the database and tables.
3. Run `customer_data.sql` to populate the tables with sample data.
4. Run the query scripts (`total_interest_paid.sql`, `profit.sql`, `summary.sql`) to see the results.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sample data to increase the complexity of the queries.
- Implement stored procedures and triggers for more dynamic data handling.
- Integrate with a front-end application for interactive data visualization.
